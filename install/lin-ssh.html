<div>If you don’t already have one, make a GitHub account, you’ll need to write the same email address as your github account in the indicated placeholder location. Unless otherwise indicated, you’re typing all of these commands directly into the terminal.</div>
<br>
<strong>1. </strong>
<div>ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "replace-this@placeholder-example.com"</div>
<br>
<strong>2.</strong>
For the next three prompts it asks you, you can just hit enter.
<br><br>
<strong>3.</strong> 
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
<br><br>
<strong>6.</strong>
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
<br><br>
<strong>7.</strong> 
<u>Open your public key file using:</u>
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
<u>Then select the contents of that file and copy them using Ctrl+C.</u>
<br>
<strong>8.</strong> 
Go to github.com, click on your account, go to settings, click on “SSH and GPG keys”, then click “New SSH Key”, then do Command+F to paste in the key field (the last command copied the public key you need.) Name the key whatever you want, then click “Add SSH Key” and you’re done!
<br><br>
<strong>9.</strong> 
<u>To make sure your SSH setup worked, you can check by entering:</u>
ssh -T git@github.com
<em>If your system says it can't verify github's authenticity, just enter "yes" as a response</em>
